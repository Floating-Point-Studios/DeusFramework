# Deus Framework

## About
Deus is developed by Floating Point Studios for internal and externally licensed usage only.

Deus is based upon the [NevermoreEngine](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine) with security, modularity, and administration in mind. Modules from Nevermore are compatible with minimal changes required.

### Features

#### Security
* Fast network encryption deters remote-spy attacks
* ModuleScript source removal prevents much of the framework from being decompiled

#### Modularity
* During intialization modules may hook into Deus
* Developers may choose to adhere to Deus's mdoule structure to retain security or opt for a looser structure

#### Administration
* Cardinal provides tools for moderators and developers to aid in player moderation and debugging errors
* [GameAnalytics](https://gameanalytics.com/) provides developers with real-time statistics of player traffic, most frequent errors, and transactions occurring

## Installation
Deus utilizes a proprietary plugin that allows developers to choose which modules and features of Deus they would like to install. The plugin also provides a way to visually configure the installed modules.
